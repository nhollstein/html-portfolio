<p>Hi, I am Nataliana. I am a specialist in internal medicine and family medicine with a deep interest in digitalisation.
  Through years of practicing medicine I know how important it is to have an attention to details, persistence and dedication in one's field. I would love to implement this qualifications into programming and web developing.</p>

<p>That's why I enrolled to the complete 2024 web development bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu! I am not only learning the theories, but I am also implementing it through the projects.
  I am so excited to the future and how I can be a web developer and offer my skills to the world. </p>
